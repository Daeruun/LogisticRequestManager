Version: 1.1.1
Date: 02.12.2020
  Features:
    - vehicles (namely the spidertron, but should work for modded ones as well) can be used to load a preset or a blueprint into them
    - chests and vehicles (namely the spidertron, but should work for modded ones as well) can be used as source for a preset 
      => change of behaviour: 
      if no requester-entity is open, the save/load buttons will not work
      a player-specific setting is available to use the character as default then (as it was until now)
    - added 'Shift + L' as a hotkey to toggle the GUI
  Bugfixes:
    - presets can be loaded into chests again
    - blueprints can be applied to chests
